# How to Fix Dish Network Acquiring Signal 535 Stuck Error
 
If you are a Dish Network customer, you may have encountered a problem where your TV screen shows a message saying "Acquiring Signal 535" and then switches to "Complete Signal Loss 015a" every few minutes. This error means that your receiver is not getting a signal from the satellite dish, and you may miss your favorite shows or channels.
 
There are several possible causes for this error, such as bad weather, dish misalignment, cable damage, switch or LNB failure, or receiver malfunction. Fortunately, there are some troubleshooting steps you can try to fix the problem yourself before calling a technician. Here are some of them:

- **Check the weather.** Sometimes heavy rain, snow, or wind can interfere with the satellite signal and cause temporary loss of service. If the weather is bad in your area, wait until it clears up and then try to reset your receiver by unplugging it from the power outlet for 10 seconds and plugging it back in.
- **Check the dish alignment.** If the weather is fine, but your dish has been moved by strong winds or other factors, it may not be pointing at the right angle to receive the signal. You can use a compass or a smartphone app to find the correct azimuth and elevation for your dish based on your location and zip code. Then, use a wrench to loosen the bolts on the dish mount and adjust it until it matches the coordinates. You may need a helper to watch the TV screen and tell you when the signal strength improves.
- **Check the cables and connections.** Another common cause of signal loss is damaged or loose cables that connect the dish to the receiver. Inspect the cables for any cuts, kinks, corrosion, or rodents' bites. Make sure they are securely connected to the dish, the switch, and the receiver. You may also try to swap the cables with different ports or replace them with new ones if you have spare ones.
- **Check the switch and LNB.** The switch is a device that allows you to connect multiple receivers to one dish, and the LNB is a part of the dish that receives and amplifies the signal from the satellite. If either of these components is faulty, you may experience signal loss or degradation. To test them, you can run a check switch test from your receiver's menu. This will scan all the satellites and transponders that your dish can receive and display a summary on your screen. If you see fewer satellites or transponders than expected, or if you see any red Xs or error codes, it may indicate a problem with your switch or LNB. You may need to replace them with new ones or call a technician for assistance.
- **Check the receiver.** If none of the above steps resolve your issue, it may be due to a problem with your receiver itself. You can try to reset it by unplugging it from the power outlet for 10 seconds and plugging it back in. You can also try to update its software by pressing the menu button on your remote, selecting settings, then diagnostics, then tools, then update software. If these methods do not work, you may need to contact Dish Network customer service and request a replacement receiver or schedule a service visit.
