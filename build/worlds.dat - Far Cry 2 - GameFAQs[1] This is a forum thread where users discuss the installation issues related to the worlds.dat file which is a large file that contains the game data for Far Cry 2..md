## What are .dat and .fat files?
 
.dat and .fat files are archive formats used by Far Cry 2 to store various game data, such as sounds, models, textures, scripts, maps, etc. The .dat files contain the actual data, while the .fat files contain the index and structure of the data. The .dat and .fat files are usually paired together and have the same name, such as worlds.dat and worlds.fat. The game uses these files to load the necessary data when needed.
 
## Why open and extract .dat and .fat files?
 
Opening and extracting .dat and .fat files can allow you to access and modify the game data, such as changing the sounds, models, textures, scripts, maps, etc. This can enhance your gaming experience or create new content for the game. For example, you can replace the weapons sounds with your own sounds, change the appearance of the characters or vehicles, add new objects or enemies to the map, tweak the game settings or mechanics, etc.

You can download it from [here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/far-cry-2-redux/downloads/far-cry-2-mod-tools). To use it, you need to drag the .fat file to the unpack.exe file in the tools folder. This will create a folder with the same name as the .fat file containing all the extracted data. You can then edit or replace any file you want. To repack the data, you need to drag the folder back to the pack.exe file in the tools folder. This will create a new .dat and .fat file with your changes.

You can use any hex editor you like, such as HxD or Hex Workshop. To use it, you need to open both the .dat and .fat file in separate tabs or windows of your hex editor. You can then locate the data you want to edit or replace by using the index and structure information from the .fat file.
