Manthrikam is a form of magic that involves the use of mantras, yantras (geometrical diagrams), tantras (rituals), mudras (gestures), herbs, stones, metals, animals, and other objects to achieve various purposes. Some of these purposes include healing, protection, attraction, destruction, divination, and enlightenment.
 
Manthrikam is believed to have originated from the ancient Vedic traditions of India, and later influenced by various other religious and cultural streams such as Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Christianity, tribal beliefs, and folk practices. Manthrikam is also closely related to other forms of magic such as siddha (Tamil), kala jadu (Hindi), vashikaran (Hindi), mayong (Assamese), etc.
