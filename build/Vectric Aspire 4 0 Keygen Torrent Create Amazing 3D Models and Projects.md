Vectric Aspire 4.0 is a software that allows you to create 2D and 3D designs, and then generate toolpaths to cut them on a CNC machine. It is based on the same platform as Vectric's VCarve Pro software, but with additional features and capabilities to create 3D models and relief sculptures. You can import 3D files from other programs, or create your own 3D components from 2D vectors or images. You can also edit and sculpt your 3D models interactively, and combine them with other elements to create complex projects.
 
Aspire 4.0 has a variety of tools to help you design and machine your projects efficiently and accurately. You can use smart snapping and transform shortcuts to draw and edit vectors easily. You can also use the texture area tool to create tilable textures from 3D models or images. Aspire 4.0 supports two-sided machining, wrapped rotary axis machining, and multi-sided 3D simulation. You can also create project toolpaths that follow the shape of a 3D model or a curved surface.

Aspire 4.0 has a range of toolpath options to suit different types of projects and materials. You can create v-carving and 3D engraving toolpaths for decorative effects, raised prism machining for lettering and logos, fluting toolpaths with ramp in/out options for smooth transitions, pocketing toolpaths with efficient multi-tool options for clearing large areas, drilling toolpaths with peck cycle option for deep holes, beveled letters for signs and plaques, and more. You can also use user-definable shaped form cutters for custom profiles.
 
Aspire 4.0 is compatible with Windows XP (SP3), Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10. It requires a 2 GHz multi-core CPU, 4 GB RAM, and 300 MB of free hard disk space. You can download a free trial version of Aspire 4.0 from Vectric's website[^1^], or buy the full version for $1995 USD[^1^]. Aspire 4.0 also comes with online clipart access, text editing with single stroke fonts, true shape nesting, job setup sheets, helical arc support, and more.
 
If you are looking for a powerful design and machining software that can handle both 2D and 3D projects, you should consider Vectric Aspire 4.0. It is a versatile and user-friendly software that can help you create stunning designs and cut them on your CNC machine with ease.
  
## Examples of Projects Made with Aspire 4.0
 
Aspire 4.0 can be used to create a wide range of projects, from simple signs and plaques to intricate sculptures and carvings. Here are some examples of projects made with Aspire 4.0 by Vectric and its customers:
 
- A 3D carved wooden eagle with realistic feathers and details[^1^]. This project was made by combining several 3D models from Vectric's clipart library, and using different toolpaths to create the depth and texture of the eagle.
- A cribbage board with a custom design and a high-performance drill bit[^2^]. This project was made by using VCarve Pro to create the vector design, and then importing it into Aspire 4.0 to add the 3D components and toolpaths. The drill bit was specially designed to cut through the material quickly and cleanly.
- A glass engraving with a drag bit and a rotary axis[^2^]. This project was made by using Aspire 4.0 to create the vector design, and then using a wrapped rotary axis toolpath to engrave it on a glass cylinder. The drag bit was used to create a smooth and consistent engraving without chipping the glass.

## Advantages of Aspire over VCarve
 
Aspire 4.0 is based on the same platform as VCarve Pro, but with additional features and capabilities to create 3D models and relief sculptures. Here are some of the advantages of Aspire over VCarve:

- Aspire 4.0 has a 3D modeling tab that allows you to create your own 3D components from scratch, or import 3D files from other programs. You can also edit and sculpt your 3D models interactively, and combine them with other elements to create complex projects.
- Aspire 4.0 has more toolpath options for 3D machining, such as raised prism machining, beveled letters, project toolpaths, and more. You can also use user-definable shaped form cutters for custom profiles.
- Aspire 4.0 has more clipart options for 3D projects, such as animals, plants, ornaments, textures, and more. You can also access online clipart from Vectric's website.

If you want to create more than just 2D projects, you should consider upgrading to Aspire 4.0. It is a powerful and versatile software that can help you unleash your creativity and make stunning 3D designs and carvings.
