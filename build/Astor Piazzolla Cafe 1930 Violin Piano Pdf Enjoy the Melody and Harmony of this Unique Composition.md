Astor Piazzolla (1921-1992) was an Argentine composer and bandoneon player who revolutionized the tango genre by incorporating elements of jazz, classical music and other styles. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and innovative musicians of the 20th century.
 
One of his most famous works is Histoire du Tango, a suite for flute and guitar (or other instruments) that traces the evolution of tango from its origins in the late 19th century to its modern forms. The second movement, CafÃ© 1930, depicts the golden age of tango, when it was popularized by singers, orchestras and dancers in the cafÃ©s and cabarets of Buenos Aires.

CafÃ© 1930 is a nostalgic and melancholic piece that contrasts the rhythmic and lively style of traditional tango with the lyrical and expressive style of Piazzolla's new tango. The melody is mainly played by the flute (or violin), while the guitar (or piano) provides the accompaniment and occasional counterpoint. The piece has a ternary form (A-B-A), with a central section that introduces some chromaticism and dissonance.

Astor Piazzolla's life was marked by many travels and encounters with different musical cultures. He lived in New York City for most of his childhood, where he was exposed to jazz and classical music. He also met Carlos Gardel, the legendary tango singer and actor, who invited him to join his tour as a bandoneon player. However, Piazzolla's father refused to let him go, and he later learned that Gardel and his entire orchestra died in a plane crash. [^1^]
 
Piazzolla returned to Argentina in 1936 and began his career as a tango musician, playing with various orchestras and forming his own. He also studied classical composition with Alberto Ginastera, one of the leading Argentine composers of the time. He won a scholarship to study in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, a renowned teacher who had taught many famous composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Aaron Copland. Boulanger encouraged Piazzolla to develop his own style and to explore the possibilities of the tango. [^2^]

Piazzolla created a new genre called nuevo tango, which combined the traditional elements of tango with influences from jazz, classical music and other styles. He experimented with different instruments, such as the electric guitar, the saxophone and the flute, and different forms, such as the fugue, the concerto and the symphony. He also collaborated with many artists from different fields, such as writers Jorge Luis Borges and Horacio Ferrer, poet Pablo Neruda, painter Antonio Berni and filmmaker Fernando Solanas. [^3^]
 
Piazzolla's music was not always well received by the tango purists, who considered it a betrayal of the tradition. He also faced political difficulties during the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. He had to leave his country several times and lived in France, Italy and the United States. However, he also gained international recognition and admiration for his originality and creativity. He performed in many prestigious venues and festivals around the world and received many awards and honors. He died in Buenos Aires in 1992 after suffering a stroke. [^1^]
