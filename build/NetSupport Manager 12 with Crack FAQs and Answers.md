Some of the new features and enhancements in NetSupport Manager 12.8 include:
 
- Showing applications: You can now display applications to the end user in a separate window, allowing them to continue using their own screen as normal. This helps to maintain their productivity levels. You can also show applications on multiple screens to an end user and compress them to display the whole desktop.
- HTTP access: You can now control HTTP access based on the IP address of the person. This helps to enhance the security of the Gateway even further.
- Filter list of clients: You can now filter your list of clients by name, username, address, and description. This helps you to find and connect to clients quickly and efficiently.
- Thumbnail view: The thumbnails of connected devices have been further optimized to improve performance.
- Feedback mode: NetSupport School (provided free within NetSupport Manager) allows you to capture feedback from your end users, such as during a training session or a lesson. You can check their understanding of the topic or gauge their mood.
- Easy mode: NetSupport School also includes three modes for using the Console's user interface: Easy, Intermediate, and Advanced. The new 'Easy' mode allows less tech-savvy users to only see and use the basic core tools, supporting simplicity and ease of use.
