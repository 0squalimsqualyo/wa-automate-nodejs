You can find the original unmodified version of the game at [this link\[^1^\]](https://forums.revora.net/topic/105190-bfme1bfme2rotwk-games-download-installation-guide/).

Bfme 1 is a fun and immersive game that lets you control the forces of good or evil in the epic battles of Middle-earth. You can choose from four factions: Rohan, Gondor, Isengard, and Mordor, and command heroes like Gandalf, Aragorn, Saruman, and the Witch-king. You can also create your own custom hero with unique abilities and items. The game features a single-player campaign that follows the events of the movies, as well as skirmish and multiplayer modes where you can fight against AI or human opponents on various maps.
 
Some of the features that make Bfme 1 stand out from other RTS games are:

- The living world: The game's environments are dynamic and responsive to your actions. You can destroy trees, buildings, and bridges, create fire and smoke effects, and leave footprints and blood trails on the ground. You can also interact with wildlife such as birds, deer, and wargs.
- The morale system: Your units have morale that affects their performance in battle. Morale can be boosted by nearby heroes, banners, or buildings, or lowered by enemy attacks, fear effects, or losses. Morale can also affect your enemy's units, making them flee or surrender.
- The command points system: Your army size is limited by command points, which are determined by your faction and the number of farms or slaughterhouses you have. You can increase your command points by building more farms or slaughterhouses, or by capturing outposts or settlements on the map. You can also use powers to temporarily increase your command points.
- The power system: You can earn power points by destroying enemy units or buildings, or by completing objectives. You can use power points to unlock and activate various powers that can aid you in battle. Powers range from passive bonuses to active abilities such as summoning reinforcements, casting spells, or unleashing devastating attacks.

If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies or books, or if you enjoy strategy games in general, you will surely love playing Bfme 1. With its rich graphics, sound effects, and gameplay mechanics, Bfme 1 will immerse you in the world of Middle-earth like never before.
