# sulla

> Sulla is a javascript library which provides a high-level API control to Whatsapp so it can be configured to automatize resposes or any data that goes trough Whatsapp effortlessly. 
>
> It is built using [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and based on [this python wrapper](https://github.com/mukulhase/WebWhatsapp-Wrapper)


## Installation

```bash
> npm i sulla
```

## Usage

```javascript
// import { create, Whatsapp } from 'sulla';
const sulla = require('sulla');

sulla.create().then(client => start(client));

function start(client) {
  client.onMessage(message => {
    if (message.body === 'Hi') {
      client.sendText(message.from, 'ðŸ‘‹ Hello from sulla!');
    }
  });
}
```

###### After executing `create()` function, **sulla** will create an instance of whatsapp web. If you are not logged in, it will print a QR code in the [terminal](https://i.imgur.com/g8QvERI.png). Scan it with your phone and you are ready to go!
###### sulla will remember the session so there is no need to authenticate everytime.

## Decrypting Media

Here is a sample of how to decrypt media. This has been tested on images, videos, documents, audio. It does not work for voice notes right now, or I don't have the right codecs to play them.

```
import { create, Whatsapp, decryptMedia} from 'sulla-hotfix';
const mime = require('mime-types')
const fs = require('fs');

function start(client: Whatsapp) {
  client.onMessage(async message => {
  if(message.mimetype) {
    const mediaData =  await decryptMedia(message);
    fs.writeFile(`${message.t}.${mime.extension(message.mimetype)}`, mediaData, function (err) {
      if (err) {
          return console.log(err);
      }
      console.log("The file was saved!");
  });
  }
  });
}

create().then(client => start(client));
```
